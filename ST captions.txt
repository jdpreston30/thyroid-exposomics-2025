ST3 FOOTNOTES
*- The lower bound of the range is the ‘theoretical minimum,’ which is one half the lowest detected value. This value was used for imputing missing values to determine means.
†- PAH measurements were obtained from a study that analyzed multiple adipose tissue depots across two geographically distinct cohorts,11 while PCB measurements were derived from a separate study that also included two geographically distinct cohorts.16  Thus, multiple means were listed for various subgroups within these studies. However, for each compound, the highest mean value reported across any cohort or cohort-tissue depot combination is presented.
‡- Some urine or plasma values are derived from the CDC’s Biomonitoring Data Tables for Environmental Chemicals,14 which is based on data from NHANES cohorts. In the cases where compounds had data listed from multiple cohorts, the maximum geometric mean across any given cohort is listed.
§- Measurements were listed for both smokers and non-smokers. All values listed are derived from smokers, which had the highest values for all these chemicals.
‖- Measured in a cohort with known occupational exposure.15  For this cohort, a range was listed from 0·1 PPB to 37 PPB; however, the maximum value of 37 PPB is presented in the table.
