\noindent{\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont\textbf{Spectral validation of select chemical identifications in thyroid tumor samples.} Sample spectra for all chemicals which showed differences in variants (quantity or presence), displayed either as mirrored plots with reference standard (sample intensity in positive y-axis, standard intensity in negative y-axis) or as non-mirrored plots without standard when reference co-elution was inadequate. Mirrored plots with co-elution of multiple fragments in both standard and sample are considered ``Level 1'' identifications (2.1, pp. 7-28), while non-mirrored plots where multiple fragments co-elute in the sample but the standard does not show proper co-elution are considered ``Level 2'' identifications (2.2, pp. 29-31). Asterisks (*) indicate the fragment used for statistical comparison and displayed in Figure 3 and/or Table 3. For select compounds, additional plots display isolated fragments for enhanced visualization clarity.}
