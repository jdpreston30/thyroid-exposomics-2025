\noindent{\fontsize{12}{14.4}\selectfont\textbf{SUPPLEMENTARY TABLE 1}}

\noindent{\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont\textbf{The full library of xenobiotic chemicals employed for chemical annotation and identification.} The library of 710 confirmed xenobiotic chemicals employed for chemical identification. All chemicals besides those which were purchased as part of a mixture with variable concentrations were present in pooled reference plasma at a concentration of 0·47 ng/mL. There are 710 total unique chemicals (i.e., unique CAS numbers), but for some chemicals, there are multiple fragments and/or retention times from different standards used for annotation and identification, thus resulting in 892 total rows in the table. The column "Target RT (min.)" refers to the library retention time for the given chemical. The individual mz columns indicate typical fragments observed for the given chemical. \textit{*Both an endogenous and exogenous (xenobiotic) chemical; $^\dagger$Additional fragments used for validation besides those listed in mz0--mz3.}}

\noindent{\fontsize{12}{14.4}\selectfont\textbf{SUPPLEMENTARY TABLE 3}}

\noindent{\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont\textbf{Comparison of quantitative values in literature.} The geometric mean or mean values for all chemicals from literature with quantitative values. The `type' column indicates which type of biological matrix the quantitative value was collected from. The 'type detail' column specifies if there were specific descriptors provided with the values, such as: 1) smokers/nonsmokers, 2) high-exposure status, 3) adipose tissue depot, or 4) cohort. In some cases, the same compound had multiple quantitative values listed from different studies. The values listed in the table are the maximum values across all studies and cohorts. The values listed in the range columns indicate the range of values in both the literature and in the present study. The high end of the range indicates the maximum value. When the low end of the range is below the detection limits, the range is listed with a less than sign. When the low end of the range is missing or not listed in the literature, the low end of the range is the theoretical minimum value (i.e., one half of the lowest value actually detected).}

\noindent{\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont\textbf{Quantitative estimates for all chemicals detected in both tumor and non-neoplastic thyroid tissue.} This table lists the estimated PPB values for all chemicals annotated in both tumor samples and non-neoplastic thyroid tissue. The estimated PPB values are calculated by taking the mean area for each chemical and dividing it by the mean area from reference standards with known concentrations (0·47 ng/mL). Chemicals are sorted alphabetically.}
