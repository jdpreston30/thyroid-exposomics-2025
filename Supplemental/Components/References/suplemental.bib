  abstract = {Background: Scientists have long been driven by the desire to describe, organize, classify, and compare objects using taxonomies and/or ontologies. In contrast to biology, geology, and many other scientific disciplines, the world of chemistry still lacks a standardized chemical ontology or taxonomy. Several attempts at chemical classification have been made; but they have mostly been limited to either manual, or semi-automated proof-of-principle applications. This is regrettable as comprehensive chemical classification and description tools could not only improve our understanding of chemistry but also improve the linkage between chemistry and many other fields. For instance, the chemical classification of a compound could help predict its metabolic fate in humans, its druggability or potential hazards associated with it, among others. However, the sheer number (tens of millions of compounds) and complexity of chemical structures is such that any manual classification effort would prove to be near impossible. Results: We have developed a comprehensive, flexible, and computable, purely structure-based chemical taxonomy (ChemOnt), along with a computer program (ClassyFire) that uses only chemical structures and structural features to automatically assign all known chemical compounds to a taxonomy consisting of {$>$}4800 different categories. This new chemical taxonomy consists of up to 11 different levels (Kingdom, SuperClass, Class, SubClass, etc.) with each of the categories defined by unambiguous, computable structural rules. Furthermore each category is named using a consensus-based nomenclature and described (in English) based on the characteristic common structural properties of the compounds it contains. The ClassyFire webserver is freely accessible at http://classyfire.wishartlab.com/. Moreover, a Ruby API version is available at https://bitbucket.org/wishartlab/classyfire\_api, which provides programmatic access to the ClassyFire server and database. ClassyFire has been used to annotate over 77 million compounds and has already been integrated into other software packages to automatically generate textual descriptions for, and/ or infer biological properties of over 100,000 compounds. Additional examples and applications are provided in this paper. Conclusion: ClassyFire, in combination with ChemOnt (ClassyFire's comprehensive chemical taxonomy), now allows chemists and cheminformaticians to perform large-scale, rapid and automated chemical classification. Moreover, a freely accessible API allows easy access to more than 77 million ``ClassyFire'' classified compounds. The results can be used to help annotate well studied, as well as lesser-known compounds. In addition, these chemical classifications can be used as input for data integration, and many other cheminformatics-related tasks.},

  abstract = {The exposome is the cumulative measure of environmental influences and associated biological responses throughout the lifespan, including exposures from the environment, diet, behavior, and endogenous processes. A major challenge for exposome research lies in the development of robust and affordable analytic procedures to measure the broad range of exposures and associated biologic impacts occurring over a lifetime. Biomonitoring is an established approach to evaluate internal body burden of environmental exposures, but use of biomonitoring for exposome research is often limited by the high costs associated with quantification of individual chemicals. High-resolution metabolomics (HRM) uses ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry with minimal sample preparation to support high-throughput relative quantification of thousands of environmental, dietary, and microbial chemicals. HRM also measures metabolites in most endogenous metabolic pathways, thereby providing simultaneous measurement of biologic responses to environmental exposures. The present research examined quantification strategies to enhance the usefulness of HRM data for cumulative exposome research. The results provide a simple reference standardization protocol in which individual chemical concentrations in unknown samples are estimated by comparison to a concurrently analyzed, pooled reference sample with known chemical concentrations. The approach was tested using blinded analyses of amino acids in human samples and was found to be comparable to independent laboratory results based on surrogate standardization or internal standardization. Quantification was reproducible over a 13-month period and extrapolated to thousands of chemicals. The results show that reference standardization protocol provides an effective strategy that will enhance data collection for cumulative exposome research. In principle, the approach can be extended to other types of mass spectrometry and other analytical methods.},

Tens of thousands of chemicals are used in commerce, yet cost for targeted environmental chemical analysis limits surveillance to a few hundred known hazards. To overcome limitations which prevent scaling to thousands of chemicals, we develop a single-step express liquid extraction and gas chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis to operationalize the human exposome. We show that the workflow supports quantification of environmental chemicals in human plasma (200\,\textmu L) and tissue ({$\leq$}100\,mg) samples. The method also provides high resolution, sensitivity and selectivity for exposome epidemiology of mass spectral features without a priori knowledge of chemical identity. The simplicity of the method can facilitate harmonization of environmental biomonitoring between laboratories and enable population level human exposome research with limited sample volume.},

  abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are one of the most prevalent classes of environmental pollutants. Some evidence shows that PAHs could be involved in human obesity. However, little is known about the distribution patterns of PAHs in human adipose tissue (AT) and the role of PAHs on adipogenesis/lipogenesis. The aims of this pilot study were to determine concentrations of 16 PAHs defined as high-priority pollutants in the plasma and adipose tissue of French and Polish bariatric patients, as well as their correlation with body mass index (BMI), plasma and AT adipokines expression levels. We finally investigated the role of naphthalene on cell proliferation, viability, and differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The concentration of most PAHs was similar in the three types of AT and it was significantly higher in AT as compared to plasma, suggesting bioaccumulation. Polish patients had higher PAH levels in AT than French ones. Only the concentration of naphthalene in AT was positively correlated with the BMI and serum or adipose chemerin, adiponectin and resistin expression, in French but not in Polish patients, who had significantly higher BMIs. Moreover, naphthalene exposure increased the cell proliferation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and lipogenesis, and increased the expression of genes involved in adipogenesis after cell differentiation. Taken together, PAHs and more particularly naphthalene could be an obesogenic molecule and increase the risk of obesity.},

  abstract = {Background: Mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with online separation methods is commonly applied for differential and quantitative profiling of biological samples in metabolomic as well as proteomic research. Such approaches are used for systems biology, functional genomics, and biomarker discovery, among others. An ongoing challenge of these molecular profiling approaches, however, is the development of better data processing methods. Here we introduce a new generation of a popular open-source data processing toolbox, MZmine 2. Results: A key concept of the MZmine 2 software design is the strict separation of core functionality and data processing modules, with emphasis on easy usability and support for high-resolution spectra processing. Data processing modules take advantage of embedded visualization tools, allowing for immediate previews of parameter settings. Newly introduced functionality includes the identification of peaks using online databases, MSn data support, improved isotope pattern support, scatter plot visualization, and a new method for peak list alignment based on the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. The performance of the RANSAC alignment was evaluated using synthetic datasets as well as actual experimental data, and the results were compared to those obtained using other alignment algorithms. Conclusions: MZmine 2 is freely available under a GNU GPL license and can be obtained from the project website at: http://mzmine.sourceforge.net/. The current version of MZmine 2 is suitable for processing large batches of data and has been applied to both targeted and non-targeted metabolomic analyses.},

Additionally, in the occupationally exposed persons hemoglobin adduct levels of arylamines were determined by a liquid chromatography-electrochemical detector method, together with the individual acetylator status. The aromatic amines aniline, p-toluidine, 2-naphthylamine, and 4-chloro-o-toluidine were detected in the urine of nonsmoking subjects who were not occupationally exposed to arylamines. Significantly higher concentrations of aniline, o-toluidine, m-toluidine, 2-naphthylamine, and 4-methyl-1,3-phenylenediamine could be observed in the urine of smoking control persons in comparison to nonsmokers. Comparison of smokers and nonsmokers in a group of workers primarily exposed to aniline and 4-chloroaniline revealed significant differences (P {$<$} 0.05) in the formation of 4-aminodiphenyl hemoglobin adducts and in the renal excretion of 2-naphthylamine. The slow acetylators in this group produced significantly more hemoglobin adducts of aniline and 4-chloroaniline than did the fast acetylators. In slow acetylators among the smoking workers there was a significant increase in the formation of 4-aminodiphenyl hemoglobin adducts and in the renal excretion of 4-chloroaniline and m-toluidine. The results indicate that there are influences of smoking habits and acetylator status on the levels of arylamine hemoglobin adducts as well as urinary arylamine concentrations. Hemoglobin adducts seem to be good parameters for monitoring aniline and 4-chloroaniline exposure at the workplace, especially if the acetylator polymorphism can be taken into account. 4-Aminodiphenyl hemoglobin adducts might be good parameters for monitoring individual smoking habits. The determination of urinary arylamine concentrations provides additional information concerning acute exposures to aromatic amines.},

Various methods have been applied for handling missing values, but the selection can significantly affect following data analyses. Typically, there are three types of missing values, missing not at random (MNAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing completely at random (MCAR). Our study comprehensively compared eight imputation methods (zero, half minimum (HM), mean, median, random forest (RF), singular value decomposition (SVD), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and quantile regression imputation of left-censored data (QRILC)) for different types of missing values using four metabolomics datasets. Normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and NRMSE-based sum of ranks (SOR) were applied to evaluate imputation accuracy. Principal component analysis (PCA)/partial least squares (PLS)-Procrustes analysis were used to evaluate the overall sample distribution. Student's               t               -test followed by correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects on univariate statistics. Our findings demonstrated that RF performed the best for MCAR/MAR and QRILC was the favored one for left-censored MNAR.

  abstract = {The exposome is defined as the totality of all human environmental exposures from conception to death. It is often regarded as the complement to the genome, with the interaction between the exposome and the genome ultimately determining one's phenotype. The `toxic exposome' is the complete collection of chronically or acutely toxic compounds to which humans can be exposed. Considerable interest in defining the toxic exposome has been spurred on by the realization that most human injuries, deaths and diseases are directly or indirectly caused by toxic substances found in the air, water, food, home or workplace. The Toxin-ToxinTarget Database (T3DB - www.t3db.ca) is a resource that was specifically designed to capture information about the toxic exposome. Originally released in 2010, the first version of T3DB contained data on nearly 2900 common toxic substances along with detailed information on their chemical properties, descriptions, targets, toxic effects, toxicity thresholds, sequences (for both targets and toxins), mechanisms and references. To more closely align itself with the needs of epidemiologists, toxicologists and exposome scientists, the latest release of T3DB has been substantially upgraded to include many more compounds ({$>$}3600), targets ({$>$}2000) and gene expression datasets ({$>$}15 000 genes). It now includes extensive data on `normal' toxic compound concentrations in human biofluids as well as detailed chemical taxonomies, informative chemical ontologies and a large number of referential NMR, MS/MS and GC-MS spectra. This manuscript describes the most recent update to the T3DB, which was previously featured in the 2010 NAR Database Issue.},
