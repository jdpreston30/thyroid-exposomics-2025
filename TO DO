You need to do the following:
-validate top 5 quant, add spectra to supplementals
-validate IARC 1 tumor quant comaprisons, add spectra to supplementals
-MIX LIST needs to be accounted for and revised for creation of ST3 and 4
-Ensure mix list does not intersect with anyh IARC

- Use open xlsx to write both table 1 and 3 to match the formatting
- update decimal formatting on tables 1 and 3 to be the middle one thing

-remove non quantittative chemicals from PPM (main figure 3) and PPM tables (3 and 4) in supplementary. Will will determine this, and these will be chemicals which were part of  a mix rather than being a single standard
- specify this in the methods that we had to remove these chemicals in mixtures. In expanded methods
-modify figure 3 raw file based on new PPM calc
-Add Will to author portal file
